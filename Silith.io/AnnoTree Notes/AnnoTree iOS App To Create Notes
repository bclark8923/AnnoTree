Where do i get this brings up a Help Screen - Will say:
	Sign up on AnnoTree.com for our beta
	When you get access, you can create a tree
	A tree can represent the website you are working on
	Here you can go to developer resources to get your identifier

Eventually bulding login/sign up and create tree/send to tree on this screen would be best
