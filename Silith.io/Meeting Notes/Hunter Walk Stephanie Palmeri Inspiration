What We Have
	An SDK to your mobile app for drawing on it
	Sending these images to our central platform
	Commenting on these Images
	Simple responsive design for any device
	Could easily tie this as an add-on to Jira or basecamp or Trello or any other PM/QA tool

Where I want to Go
	A platform for tracking app ideas, app designs, product backlog, and product bugs in different branches
	Can send in ideas to these from any device extremely easily
	Doesn't tie into the big guys, is a full suite replacement for them for application creators
	Innovative interface using video game like scrolling through tree/branches/leaves
	Something no one has attempted to do - don't want to come off as cheesy but interactive


How are we different
	Jira is the big player, Offers from start to finish
	Jira can be clunky, large, not the best
	We can do better
	The Small Business Jira
	Basecamp > Pivotal Tracker | AnnoTree > Jira
